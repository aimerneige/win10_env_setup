# win10_env_setup

## Introduction

This is an article about how to build my own windows development environment.

[English](README.md)\
[简体中文](README-CN.md)

## System

I am using the en_windows_10_enterprise_ltsc_2019_x64 edition of windows 10.

It is doesn't matter what kind of system edition you are using, but I highly recommend you use this edition because it is super clean and doesn't contain much useless software and service. So, you can just install what you need and let the useless software gone.
